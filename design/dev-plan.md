Players will spend most of their time in three places: The World Map, the Place Map, Conversations, and Battles.

The first stage of development will focus on the Place Map, Conversations, and Battles. The World Map will be added later, once the core gameplay systems are in place. The World Map will serve as a hub to access different Places. The player's party will be able to travel between Places on the World Map, and there may be interruptions to their travel to either trigger hidden Places, Conversations, or Battles.

The Narrative is the story that the player experiences through these systems. The Narrator system will act on the Narrative by triggering Narrative Events such as triggering a Conversation or a Battle, revealing a Place Map, changing a Quest state, updating the player's inventory, modifying character stats, etc.

The Narrator is basically a "Game Master" that controls the flow of the game.
